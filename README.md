# Arduino-project-tutorial  
Data from the natural environment is invisible but still relevant to us. The purpose of this tutorial is to obtain and extract data from the natural environment and visualise it through Arduino. From the beginning, we will introduce the connection and use of Arduino and various natural environment sensors, and finally present the invisible environmental data. From the basics of temperature and humidity in the environment to climate and various gases, sound, light, water, soil. Detect changes in the micro-environment by building a small mobile climate observatory yourself.

- ### Chapter 1: Introduction to Arduino ###
- "Chapter 1 provides a comprehensive overview of Arduino, including its history, evolution, and various models. We delve into why Arduino is an excellent tool for environmental observation, supported by real-world examples and case studies, to illustrate its impactful applications."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Arduino Environment ###
- "In Chapter 2, we walk you through the initial steps of setting up your Arduino environment. This includes a detailed list of required materials and tools, recommendations for sourcing components, and a step-by-step guide to installing and understanding the Arduino IDE interface."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 3: Basic Arduino Programming ###
- "Chapter 3 introduces you to the basics of Arduino programming. You'll learn about the structure of Arduino code, including setup and loop functions, basic syntax, and conventions. The chapter culminates in your first Arduino project – a blinking LED – where you will wire a circuit and write your first program."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 4: Working with Environmental Sensors ###
- "This chapter focuses on environmental sensors. You'll get an overview of different types of sensors and how to select the right one for your project. It includes practical guidance on connecting these sensors to Arduino and reading the data they collect."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 5: Data Collection and Analysis ###
- "Chapter 5 delves into the methods of data collection and analysis. You'll learn about various techniques for data logging, organizing, and storing data efficiently. The chapter also covers basic data analysis techniques and how to visualize data effectively."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 6: Building Environmental Monitoring Projects ###
- "In Chapter 6, you will apply your skills to build three different environmental monitoring projects: a DIY Weather Station, an Indoor Air Quality Monitor, and a Soil Moisture Monitoring System. Each project integrates multiple concepts and skills you've learned so far."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 7: Troubleshooting and Best Practices ###
- "This chapter addresses common challenges in Arduino projects, offering solutions and troubleshooting tips. It also provides best practices in Arduino programming and circuit design, emphasizing coding standards, conventions, and safety guidelines."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 8: Advancing Your Skills ###
- "The final chapter encourages you to advance your skills beyond the basics. It introduces advanced topics like IoT with Arduino and wireless module integration. The chapter also guides you on engaging with the Arduino community and exploring further resources for continuous learning."  
<br>

- ### Chapter 9: More sensor code examples ###
- Chapter 9 is actually an additional appendix, which is some example codes for common sensor production (optimized and improved based on the Arduin library). And try to explain the meaning of each line of code, so that everyone can more easily understand the meaning and function of each line of code. And this list is growing, I will try my best to keep adding new and various sensors.
  
- Sensor with full code and explanation added:
  | Type: | Sensors: |   |  |  |  |  |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | Temperature & Humidity |  DHT 11  |  DHT 22  |  SHT 31  |  SHT 40  |  SHT 41  |  SHT 45  |
  | Air quality |  SGP 30  |  SGP 30  |
  | Pressure & Altimeter |  BMP 280  |  BMP 388  |  BMP 390  |
  | Ambient light |  TSL 2561  |  TSL 2591  |
  | LCD module |  LCD 1602A  |
